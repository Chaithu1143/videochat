# VideoChat Project

**Project Description:**

This VideoChat project is a web application that enables real-time video and audio communication over the internet. It utilizes the Agora.io platform for video call functionality, allowing users to join or host video conferences with ease. The core features of this project include camera and microphone control, stream joining, and leaving the stream. 

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Agora.io SDK

**Key Features:**

1. **Camera and Microphone Control:** Users can easily toggle their camera and microphone on and off during a video call. This provides privacy and convenience during video conferencing.

2. **Stream Joining:** Users can join an existing video chat session by entering the relevant channel ID. This allows participants to connect and collaborate in real-time, whether it's for business meetings, virtual events, or personal catch-ups.

3. **Temporary Token Management:** Security is a top priority, and the project uses temporary tokens for Agora.io, which are valid for 24 hours. This ensures that only authorized participants can join the video call.

**How to Use:**

1. Sign up and get an App ID from [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io/).
2. Create a channel using the App ID to set up your video call.
3. Use the provided channel ID to invite participants to your video chat session.
4. Share the temporary tokens with participants, ensuring secure access.
5. Use the project to control your camera and microphone, join and leave the video chat.
